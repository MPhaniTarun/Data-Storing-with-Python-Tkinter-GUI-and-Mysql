# Data-Storing-with-Python-Tkinter-GUI-and-Mysql
<li>The aim of this project is connecting Python and database(Mysql) using Python Tkinter GUI.</li>
<li>This code has been configured for my system screen size Geometry, it can be modified for different screen sizes.</l1>
<li>Mysql should be download in-order for the code to work, since the data gets stored in database tables.</li>
<li>Things to do in Mysql:</li>
<ol>
  <li>Create a database with name 'std'.</li>
  <li>Then create a table with name 'comunity'.</li>
  <li>Inside the table create all the mentioned columns i.e,
    aadhar_no, name, age, gender, nationality, state, area_pincode, marital, religion, occupation, annual_income, contact, Mother_tongue, medical_record</li>
 </ol>
 <br> The feature names of the table can be be changed provided they are altered in the python code also.
